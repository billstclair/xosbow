The image of Da Vinci's notebook about his proposed giant crossbow is [from the Library of Congress](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3c10329).

The Barnett BCX and ki360 images are from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/)'s product pages.

I created the `xosbow-logo-*` images with my [elm-crosswords](https://github.com/billstclair/elm-crosswords) project.
