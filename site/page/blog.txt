This is the first post in the [["#xossbow"]] blog.

I'm undecided about a logo. I currently have three ideas. If you have a preference, or another idea, please send email to <Xossbow@gmail.com>. Here are my ideas:

1. I made the logo below, with [elm-crosswords](logo-maker/). It's my current favorite.

Here's a tiny version of it (81x41):

There are more sizes in the [images](images/) directory.

2. A line-drawing of a crossbow. I was unable to find one I liked in an hour-long Google search, so I would likely need to commission it."

3. The bottom half of da Vinci's [famous notebook page](images/davincis-giant-crossbow.jpg) about a giant crossbow:
