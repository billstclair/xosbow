Xossbow is pronounced "Crossbow".

Elm is a good wood for making longbows. A crossbow is a particularly powerful bow. Xossbow is a particularly powerful blogging framework, made with [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) and [HtmlTemplate](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/billstclair/elm-html-template/latest).

Page templates are written in JSON. Content may be written in JSON, Markdown, or plain text. Plain text may be wrapped by your browser, or displayed as fixed-width code. There will soon be editing forms for the [["#pageLink","settings"]] and [["#pageLink","pages"]].

The "index" link in the sidebar goes to the index page, as does clicking on the site name at the top of the page.

The "play" link in the sidebar goes to a page where you can enter Markdown and JSON and see how they parse and evaluate.

The "docs" link in the sidebar goes to the index of the Xossbow user documentation.

The "templates", "pages", "settings", and "stylesheets" links in the sidebar can be used to inspect the JSON, Markdown, and CSS that define this site.

The \[Page Source] link at the bottom of each page shows the raw source for the current page.

Clicking a page title on the index page will go to that page.
